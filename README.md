## 🚀 Overview

AI Due Diligence Copilot is a full-stack application built to simplify document analysis.

Instead of manually reading lengthy contracts, certificates, reports, or financial documents, users can upload a PDF and ask questions in plain English.

The application automatically:

- 📄 Extracts text from uploaded PDFs
- 🧹 Cleans and preprocesses the text
- ✂️ Splits the document into semantic chunks
- 🧠 Generates embeddings
- 📚 Stores embeddings inside ChromaDB
- 🔍 Retrieves the most relevant chunks using vector similarity search
- 🤖 Generates accurate responses using a local Large Language Model

Everything runs locally without relying on cloud-based vector databases.

# ⚙️ Installation

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Due-Diligence-Copilot.git

cd AI-Due-Diligence-Copilot
```

---

## Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

python -m venv .venv
```

Activate virtual environment

Windows

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux / Mac

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run FastAPI

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

---

## Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

npm install

npm run dev
```
---

## CAUTION 

```bash
Check and run ollama 
ollama --version

Verify the model exists.
ollama list

You should see something like
llama3.2:latest
```

# 🧠 How it Works

### 1. Upload a PDF

The document is uploaded to the FastAPI backend.

---

### 2. Parse Document

The backend extracts text from the uploaded PDF.

---

### 3. Text Cleaning

Special characters and unnecessary whitespace are removed.

---

### 4. Chunking

Large documents are split into manageable chunks.

---

### 5. Embeddings

Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings.

---

### 6. Vector Storage

Embeddings are stored inside ChromaDB.

---

### 7. User Question

The user asks a question.

---

### 8. Semantic Search

Relevant chunks are retrieved using vector similarity.

---

### 9. AI Answer

The retrieved context is sent to the local LLM which generates the final response.
